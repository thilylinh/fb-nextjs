          <p>
            Your privacy is critically important to us. At Middle Aged Club, we
            have a few fundamental principles:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to
              provide and the personal information that we collect about you
              through the operation of our services.
            </li>

            <li>
              We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason
              to keep it.
            </li>

            <li>
              We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what
              information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private),
              indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
            </li>

            <li>
              We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your
              personal information.
            </li>

            <li>
              We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your
              personal information.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these
            principles.
          </p>
          <h3 className="wp-block-heading">What This Policy Covers</h3>

          <p>
            Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website as
            “Services.”{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our
            products or services, like our Facebook Group, that have a separate
            privacy policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about
            you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that
            information.
          </p>

          <h3 className="wp-block-heading">Information We Collect</h3>

          <p>
            We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so —
            for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to
            make our Services better.
          </p>

          <p>
            We collect this information from three sources: if and when you
            provide information to us, automatically through operating our
            Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information
            that we collect.
          </p>

          <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
            <em>Information You Provide to Us</em>
          </h4>

          <p>
            It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you
            provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic account information:&nbsp;</strong>We ask for basic
              information from you in order to set up your account. For example,
              we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to
              provide an email address and password, along with a username or
              name — and that’s it. You may provide us with more information —
              like your address and other information you want to share — but we
              don’t require that information to create a WordPress.com account.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Public profile information:</strong>&nbsp;If you have an
              account with us, we collect the information that you provide for
              your public profile. For example, if you have a account on our
              website, your username is part of that public profile, along with
              any other information you put into your public profile, like a
              photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile
              information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind
              when deciding what information you would like to include.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Content information:&nbsp;</strong>You might provide us
              with information about you in draft and published content (a blog
              post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or
              any media or files you upload).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Communications with us :&nbsp;</strong>You may also
              provide us with information when you communicate with us about a
              support question, post comments in our public forums. When you
              communicate with us via form, email, WordPress.com comment, or
              otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any
              call recordings as permitted by applicable law).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
            <em>Information We Collect Automatically</em>
          </h4>

          <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Log information:</strong>&nbsp;Like most online service
              providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile
              devices, and servers typically make available, including the
              browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language
              preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating
              system, and mobile network information. We collect log information
              when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make
              changes to your website on WordPress.com.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Usage information:</strong>&nbsp;We collect information
              about your usage of our Services. We use this information to, for
              example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people
              use our Services so we can make our Services better, and
              understand and make predictions about user retention.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Location information:</strong>&nbsp;We may determine the
              approximate location of your device from your IP address. We
              collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how
              many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We
              may also collect information about your precise location via our
              mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location
              information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device
              operating system’s permissions.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Stored information:</strong>&nbsp;We may access
              information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We
              access this stored information through your device operating
              system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to
              access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our
              Services may access the photos stored on your device when you
              upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Interactions with other users’ sites:</strong>&nbsp;We
              collect some information about your interactions with other users’
              sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as
              your “Likes” and the fact that you commented on a particular post,
              so that we can, for example,&nbsp;recommend posts&nbsp;we think
              may interest you.{" "}
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>
                Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on
              a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to
              the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called
              web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and
              emails. We use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to
              help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences
              for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign
              effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information
              about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking,
              including how you can control the use of cookies, please see
              our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
            <em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em>
          </h4>

          <p>
            We may also get information about you from other sources. For
            example:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Third Party Login:</strong>&nbsp;If you create or log in
              to your WordPress.com account through another service (like
              Google) we’ll receive associated login information (e.g. a
              connection token, your username, your email address)
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Social Sharing Services:&nbsp;</strong>If you connect our
              website or account to a social media service (like Twitter), we’ll
              receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic
              profile information, friends list) via the authorization
              procedures for that service.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The information we receive depends on which services you use or
            authorize and what options are available.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing
            addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope
            will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like
            postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.
          </p>

          <h3 className="wp-block-heading">How and Why We Use Information</h3>

          <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
            <em>Purposes for Using Information</em>
          </h4>

          <p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>To provide our Services.</strong>&nbsp;For example, to set
              up and maintain your account, host the website, backup and restore
              your website, provide customer service, process payments and
              orders, and verify user information.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>
                To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.
              </strong>
              &nbsp;For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new
              versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and
              analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create
              new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help
              them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our
              Services easier to use.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>
                To place and manage ads in our advertising program.
              </strong>
              &nbsp;For example, to place ads on our users’ sites and some of
              our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand
              ad performance.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>
                To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the
                effectiveness of our marketing.
              </strong>
              &nbsp;For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups
              of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or
              have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our
              Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like
              how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing
              message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>
                To protect our Services, our users, and the public.
              </strong>
              &nbsp;For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and
              protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
              activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and
              protecting the rights and property of Middle Aged Club and others,
              which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or
              terminating Services.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong>&nbsp;For
              example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing
              issues.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>To customize the user experience.</strong>&nbsp;For
              example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant
              notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending
              content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new
              essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>To communicate with you.</strong>&nbsp;For example, by
              emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the
              most out of our products, or keep you up to date on our services;
              texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers
              and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you
              don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing
              communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you
              important updates relating to your account.)
            </li>
          </ul>

            <em>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</em>
          </h4>

          <p>
            A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds
            for processing information about you under EU data protection laws,
            which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds
            that:
          </p>

          <p>
            (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you
            under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you
            or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order
            to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a
            paid plan; or
          </p>

          <p>

            those of another person; or
          </p>

          <p>
            (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for
            example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services
            so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to
            safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge,
            and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand
            our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any
            problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or
          </p>

          <p>
            (5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place
            certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on,

              <strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong>&nbsp;We
              may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and
              independent contractors who need the information to help us
              provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We
              require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow

              with them.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Third-party vendors:</strong>&nbsp;We may share
              information about you with third-party vendors who need the
              information in order to provide their services to us, or to
              provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors
              that help us provide our Services to you We require vendors to

              <strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong>&nbsp;We may
              disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court
              order, or other governmental request.{" "}

              <strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong>&nbsp;We
              may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith
              that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
              rights of Middle Aged Club, third parties, or the public at large.
              For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an
              imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we&nbsp;may
              disclose information related to the emergency without delay.

              of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that
              Middle Aged Club goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
              information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred
              or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to
              happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your
              information and the party receiving your information may continue
              to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy
              Policy.

              <strong>With your consent:</strong>&nbsp;We may share and disclose
              information with your consent or at your direction. For example,
              we may share your information with third parties when you
              authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a
              social media service through our Publicize feature.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong>&nbsp;We
              may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified,
              so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For
              instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our
              Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to
              facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Published support requests:</strong>&nbsp;If you send us a
              request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of
              our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish
              that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to
              help us support other users.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users’ data.
            We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell your personal information to
            data brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies
            that want to spam you with marketing emails.
          </p>

          <p>
            We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own,
            and the revenue they generate lets us offer free access to some of
            our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a
            voice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under a new California law, the California Consumer Privacy Act
            (“CCPA”), some personalized advertising you see online and on our
            services might be considered a “sale” even though we don’t share
            information that identifies you personally, like your name or email
            address, as part of our advertising program.

            <em>Information Shared Publicly</em>
          </h4>

          <p>
            Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it —
            disclosed publicly.
          </p>

          <p>
            That means information like your public profile, posts, other
            content that you make public on your website, and your “Likes” and
            comments on other websites are all available to others — and we hope
            they get a lot of views!
          </p>

          <p>
            Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to
            share publicly.
          </p>

          <h3 className="wp-block-heading">How Long We Keep Information</h3>

          <p>
            We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer
            needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described
            in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re
            not legally required to keep it.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a
            visitor to Middle Aged Club, like the visitor’s IP address, browser
            type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the
            logs for this period of time in order to, among other things,
            analyze traffic to Middle Aged Club and investigate issues if
            something goes wrong on one of our websites.
          </p>

          <h3 className="wp-block-heading">Security</h3>

          <p>
            While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect
            information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration,
            or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor
            our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
          </p>

          <h3 className="wp-block-heading">Your Rights</h3>

          <p>
            If you are located in certain parts of the world, including
            California and countries that fall under the scope of the European
            General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have
            certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right
            to request access to or deletion of your data.
          </p>

          <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
            <em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em>

          <p>
            If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the
            GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to
            your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law,
            including the rights to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>

            <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>

            <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>

            <li>
              Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal
              data; and
            </li>

            <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You also have the right to make a complaint to a government
            supervisory authority.

            <em>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</em>
          </h4>

          <p>
            The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide
            California residents with some additional information about the
            categories of personal information we collect and share, where we
            get that personal information, and how and why we use it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of
            personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law,
            so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following
            categories of personal information from California residents,
            depending on the Services used:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and
              online identifiers);
            </li>

            <li>
              Commercial information (your billing information and purchase
              history, for example);
            </li>

            <li>
              Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide
              your gender as part of a research survey for us);
            </li>

            <li>
              Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as
              your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an
              administrator of a WordPress.com site);
            </li>

            <li>
              Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
            </li>

            <li>
              Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your
              profile picture, if you uploaded one);
            </li>

            <li>
              Professional or employment-related information (for example, your
              company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or
              information you provide in a job application); and
            </li>

            <li>
              Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).

            If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under
            the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including
            the right to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Request to know the categories of personal information we collect,
              the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting
              and using it, the categories of sources from which the information
              came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the
              specific pieces of information we collect about you;
            </li>

          <p>
            Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that
            means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible.
            We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own
            sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access
            to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to
            having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn
            revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our
            advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share
            certain device identifiers and information about your browsing
            activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising
            partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on
            some of our users’ sites and some of our own.
          </p>

          <p>
            The personal information we share includes online identifiers;
            internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie
            information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and
            geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP
            address). These disclosures may be considered a “sale” of
            information under the CCPA. We do not sell (or share) information
            through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your
            name or contact information. We don’t knowingly sell personal
            information of those under 16. Learn how you can opt out by going

            You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using

            When you contact us about one of your rights under this section,
            we’ll need to verify that you are the right person before we
            disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will
            need you to contact us from the email address associated with your
            account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a
            request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may
            still require you to verify your identity with us.

            Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our
